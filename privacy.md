# Privacy policy for the Ai'titude app

Last Updated: October 2nd, 2024
Welcome to Ai'titude! Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information when you use the Openjoy app and website.

## Information We Collect

The app has no login, therefore we do not collect any personal information and do not
create an account for th eusers.

The only personal information we collect is:

* Your climbing history: this is a free-form text where you are supposed to talk about your history with climbing; you do not have to provide any names, location, etc.

* Your climbing goals: this is what you are trying to achieve in your climbing trajectory.

* Information about injuries: we want to know if you have any injuries that could affect the training plan.


## How We Use Your Information

We share the climbing history, goals and injuries information with third-party systems, notably with Google Gemini, through the API service. You can refer to Gemini's privacy policy to understand better how it handles this data: https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en

However, since no account exists, Gemini/Google cannot link your content from Ai'titude to your Google account.


## Data Security

All the data in the app lives on your phone! It's not stored in any of Ai'titudes' servers.

## Data deletion

If you want to remove all of our data, you can just unistall the app. All the data will be deleted.


## Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal, or regulatory reasons. We will notify you about significant changes by updating the date at the top of this policy.
